# Footwear-classification-using-ConvNets

Building a footwear classification model using CNN.

E-commerce has rapidly grown and their business strategies are completely based on user actions 
and user experiences. Although it is completely based on users, we should also not forget to say 
that there is a technology bridge in between users and growth in business. 

It may be Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Companies apply many image classification techniques on data to 
improve their catalog and give best suggestions to the users. They need accurate product classification on their platforms for better user experience. 

But when you talk about products, there exists a huge variety and classifying within varieties is really challenging. As a Deep Learning
engineer, you should always try cracking these kinds of challenges by classifying things within a product itself.

Goal: Given the images of a product with multiple categories, train a model which can classify the type of a product.

Data Description: Data is all about images of shoes with multiple categories and data is collected from a popular Ecommerce site. 
Data set consists of two folders train and test.
